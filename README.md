# distributed-services-with-go-workshop

This workshop covers material from
the ["Distributed Services with Go"](https://www.amazon.ca/Distributed-Services-Go-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1680507605)
book.

Instead of the commit log application, a simplified version of
the [Campsite Booking API](https://github.com/igor-baiborodine/campsite-booking) is used as an example application.
