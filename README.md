# distributed-services-with-go-workshop

This workshop covers material from the ["Distributed Services with Go"](https://www.amazon.ca/Distributed-Services-Go-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1680507605) book. A simplified version of the [Campsite Booking API](https://github.com/igor-baiborodine/campsite-booking) is used as a sample application.
